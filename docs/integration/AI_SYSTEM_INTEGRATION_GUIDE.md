# 🤖 AI System Integration with Social Points

## Overview
This guide shows how to integrate your AI vocab and flashcard systems with the social points system to create a unified learning experience.

## 🎯 Integration Architecture

```
AI Vocab Server ──┐
                  ├──→ Points API ──→ Social Leaderboard
Flashcard Server ─┘
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **AI Vocab System Integration**
When users complete AI-generated vocabulary activities, the system automatically awards points:

**Points by Level:**
- **A1 Basic Words**: +15-25 points per session
- **A2 Intermediate Words**: +20-35 points per session  
- **B1 Advanced Words**: +25-45 points per session
- **B2 Academic Words**: +30-60 points per session
- **C1 Professional Words**: +40-80 points per session

**Example Activities:**
- AI generates 20 new A2 words → +30 points
- AI pronunciation feedback session → +20 points
- AI grammar-focused vocabulary → +40 points

### 2. **Flashcard System Integration**
When users complete flashcard activities, points are automatically awarded:

**Points by Difficulty:**
- **Easy Cards**: +10-15 points per session
- **Medium Cards**: +15-25 points per session
- **Hard Cards**: +20-35 points per session
- **Expert Cards**: +30-50 points per session

**Bonus Points:**
- **Streak Bonuses**: +10-30 points
- **Mastery Achievements**: +25-50 points
- **Spaced Repetition**: +15-25 points

**Example Activities:**
- Completed spaced repetition session → +15 points
- Achieved mastery on 15 cards → +40 points
- Maintained 7-day streak → +30 points

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints for Integration

**Award Points from AI Systems:**
```http
POST /social/users/{user_name}/points
{
    "points": 30,
    "reason": "AI generated 20 new A2 vocabulary words",
    "activity_type": "ai_vocab_generation",
    "ai_system": "vocab_generator",
    "level": "A2"
}
```

**Award Points from Flashcard System:**
```http
POST /social/users/{user_name}/points
{
    "points": 25,
    "reason": "Completed spaced repetition session",
    "activity_type": "flashcard_review",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "cards_reviewed": 20
}
```

### Integration Code Example

```python
# AI Vocab System Integration
def award_vocab_points(user_name, words_generated, level):
    points = calculate_vocab_points(words_generated, level)
    
    response = requests.post(f"{SOCIAL_API_URL}/social/users/{user_name}/points", json={
        "points": points,
        "reason": f"AI generated {words_generated} new {level} vocabulary words",
        "activity_type": "ai_vocab_generation",
        "ai_system": "vocab_generator",
        "level": level
    })
    
    return response.json()

# Flashcard System Integration  
def award_flashcard_points(user_name, cards_reviewed, difficulty):
    points = calculate_flashcard_points(cards_reviewed, difficulty)
    
    response = requests.post(f"{SOCIAL_API_URL}/social/users/{user_name}/points", json={
        "points": points,
        "reason": f"Reviewed {cards_reviewed} {difficulty} flashcards",
        "activity_type": "flashcard_review",
        "difficulty": difficulty,
        "cards_reviewed": cards_reviewed
    })
    
    return response.json()
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Integration
